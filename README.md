## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class inherits the properties and behaviors of an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user. It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. It can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

## Constructors

Constructors are special methods that are called when an object is instantiated. They are used to initialize the object.

## Static Keyword

The static keyword is used to create variables and methods that belong to the class, rather than to any particular instance. Static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

## Final Keyword

The final keyword is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance of classes. Final variables cannot be reassigned, final methods cannot be overridden, and final classes cannot be subclassed.

## This Keyword

The this keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class. It can be used to access class variables and methods, and to distinguish between class variables and parameters with the same name.

## Interface

An interface is a reference type in Java that is similar to a class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface. In interface we cab achieve 100% abstraction .
